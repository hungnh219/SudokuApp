- use bloc for sudoku board
    + devide bloc into 2 bloc: 1 for game, 1 for cell clicked
    ** use provider for cell click
    *** idea ***
    - use 2 blocs
    - cell tapped bloc for only managed the index of the chosen cell by user
    - game bloc for overall gameplay 
        + when update game board, a function from UI get the index from cell tapped bloc and pass into game bloc
          (don't call cell tapped bloc in game bloc. in this way, game bloc doesn't need to directly access or depend on the internal state of cell tapped bloc)
